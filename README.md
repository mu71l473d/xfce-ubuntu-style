# xfce-ubuntu-style

This is a quick project that I put together to give some flair to my current XFCE desktop.


    1. Extract the theme in ~/.local/share/themes or ~/.themes
        System wide installation in ${sysprefix}/local/share/themes
        Or /usr/share/themes
        
    2. Move the windows-10-icons folder to /usr/share/icons   
    
    3. Select the theme in the Window Manager Settings
    
    4. Select the theme in the Appearance settings
    
    5. Select the icons in the Appearance > Icons tab
